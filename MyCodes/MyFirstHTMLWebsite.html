    <h1>Review: Jessie Ware - What’s Your Pleasure?</h1>
    <h2>By Owen Myers</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>On her Album</strong>, Jessie Ware sounds like the host of the
      kind of party you heard about in '70s Manhattan—velvet banquettes and
      powdery surfaces, mink coats and cigarette holders, and club names that
      were enigmatic numbers, or—post-gay liberation and pre-AIDS—sincerely
      promised sanctuary, paradise.' You can imagine Ware taking a scene
      newcomer under her wing, detailing the venue's clandestine corners,
      advising which watered-down liquor to avoid—and anyway, don't you deserve
      champagne? Disco has been a shared obsession of late for both chart
      juggernauts and Ware's own peers, but her reverence for the era may be the
      most literal, down to her flash-lit portrait on the album cover, the
      spitting image of Warhol's iconic polaroid of Bianca Jagger. Here, Ware is
      a lycanthropic party girl, coming alive under the mirrorball with breathy
      flirtations over disco-funk and vibrant <strong>Hi-NRG</strong>, recreated
      deftly by chief producer James Ford. Her wonderland is, to quote Fran
      Leibowitz's one-time description of Studio 54, made for "sex and dancing."
      (Ware says as much of the record herself.) Over the Italo disco daydream
      of a title track, Ware presents a dessert trolley of options for, ahem,
      "dancing sideways." "Come on now push/Press/More/Less," she sighs over
      neon-streaked synths."Step Into My Life," co-produced by Ford and
      Kindness, is a masterclass of orchestral funk, with Ware insisting "I
      don't wanna talk, no conversation." "Save A Kiss," an outlier, extends the
      album's palette to kinetic electropop, which Ware's voice floods with
      romantic yearning. In a recent interview, Ware described What's Your
      Pleasure? as a celebration of her flourishing confidence. It has less of
      the soul-searching of Ware's previous album Glasshouse, yet zooms in on a
      lighter facet of her personality, and is threaded with a camp sense of
      humor that reflects disco's frivolity as well as the cheekiness that is
      all over Ware's Table Manners podcast but has been largely missing from
      her recorded music. Her airy vocals feel like secrets whispered,
      confidences offered, recalling Diana Ross's supple quiver over Nile Rogers
      and Bernard Edwards' beats and, in "Mirage (Don't Stop)," coming close to
      Donna Summer's orgasmic rapture. The strutting chorus of "Read My Lips"
      doubles down on the song's oral innuendo with kissy sound effects,
      bringing to mind Anita Ward's disco classic "Ring My Bell." The rubberized
      bass jam "Ooh La La" is a riot of saucy ad libs and tooting car horns, and
      the frothy, Jellybean-esque "Soul Control" centers on the delightful
      frippery "We touch and it feels like: Woo!" It is a joy to hear Ware
      sounding so relaxed. Disco music never liked to consider what happens when
      the music stops, but Ware allows a little of her signature psychodrama to
      creep into the nocturnal escapades she describes, and the flecks of ennui
      make the highs even higher. Over the darkly pulsing synths of "In Your
      Eyes," Ware is racked with insecurities. "Would you follow me, with no
      guarantee?" she asks, before allowing herself a rare belting vocal. "Adore
      You," produced by Metronomy's Joseph Mount, commits what on paper might
      seem like a cardinal sin: it Auto-Tunes Ware's pristine voice to a robotic
      murmur, the kind that could soundtrack a lonely android searching the
      cosmos. But her intonations ("Lean in...move slow"; "don't go") reshape
      the song's mood with every syllable, in a nuance that makes the smallest
      shifts feel seismic. The critic Douglas Crimp had a name—"boogie
      intimacy"—for the particular frisson you have while dancing with a
      stranger. "It's usually limited to dancing together for a while before you
      each dissolve back into the crowd," he wrote. That attitude seems to have
      galvanized Ware, too, on an album where she sounds bolder, looser — and
      frankly, more fun — than she has in a near-decade. "Last night we
      danced/And I thought you were saving my life," she sings in "Mirage (Don't
      Stop)," an evocation of communal movement as well as a mantra for the
      artistic rejuvenation that Ware finds in the groove. Her delivery is
      exquisite and carefree, suggesting an earned wisdom that a kiss is just a
      kiss, a touch is just a touch, and next Saturday night probably has more
      of both in store.
